        <h2>{3. RISK AND PAYOFF}</h2>
        <p>
        Now there is always a chance a startup will fail, so we apply a risk factor to it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Because your portion is worth <span
            class="adjustedWorth"></span> only if the company sells, you have to decide how likely that
        is.
        </p>
        <p>
        If, for example, you believe the company has a <input type="text" min="0" 
                                                              id="sellingChance"
                                                              title="What's the likelihood of the company selling?

        </p>
        <p>    
        You also won't get all your equity at once; usually there is a vesting period, meaning you get some amount for each month or year that you work.
        So let's say your   <span class="percentRevaluated"></span><b>%</b> share is paid out over  <input
                title="What is length of payout period in years?" class="tooltip" type="text" min="0"

        <p>
            Over time, you may get diluted.  This happens because the company has to take in more money in order to get to a place where it can sell itself (hence A Round, B Round, etc.)  This can actually be a good thing, because it means the company is growing and increasing in value.
            </p>
            <p>
            So imagine they took in another	$<input type="text" min="0" id="moreFunding"
                                                      title="How much more money do you think the company will need before it exits?" class="tooltip">
            at a $
            <input type="text" min="0" 
                   title="What will the post-money valuation be when the company raises more money?" class="tooltip"
                   id="secondValuation">  post-money valuation.
            </p>
            <p>
            Because they would issue new shares, your	<span class="percentOwned"></span><b>%</b> of the company is now only	<span
                class="percentRevaluated"></span><b>%</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
            But because the company is now valued at <span class="newValuation"></span> 	your portion
            is worth <span class="adjustedWorth"></span>.
